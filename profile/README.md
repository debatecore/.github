Approachable debating.

## Who are we?

We are debaters from Poznań, Poland. Our goal is to popularize the Oxford debate format (pl. _[debata oksfordzka](https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debata_oksfordzka)_) and make it easier to enter the world of debating.

## Projects

- [Debate Tools](https://github.com/debatecore/debate-tools) – a web application designed to help conduct an Oxford debate
- Tournament Planner – Oxford debate tournament made simple (coming soon)
